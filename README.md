# finalcreativecoding
My last final. 

The goal to this idea is to make an interactive peice that moves around because its more fun to mess with art. 

so I think it would be cool to maybe make the mouse to different things if its affected by the speed. or which direction its going with.

maybe sketch it out

I want the piece to be a simple shape. Modern. Clean looking. But once the the mouse goes over it. I want it to have a loop. 

It becomes trippy looking. Once the mouse touches it.

I just think that is my goal since none of my prior projects never did anything oyu just looked at it. 

I would like the piece to look like an optical illsuion. 

I love learning that the if statements will just move on if the first one is true. Hence why it needs to be better if you started with a higher number. 

Learned && (ands) and || (ors) useful to get a range of numbers going in the if else statement
